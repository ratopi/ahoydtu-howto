= Howto install AhoyDTU on ESP8266

Currently there is nofootnote:[AFAIK.]footnote:[Due to a bug in the former documentation for ESP8266.]
documentation in https://github.com/lumapu/ahoy[AhoyDTU] howto wire up with a NodeMCU based on an ESP8266.
Therefore some more information here.

== Hardware

Needed:

* ESP8266 (i.e. NodeMCU) - Microcontroller
* NRF24L01+ - Wireless transceiver module footnote:[The "\+" version is needed, because the communication happen with 250 kbps.]

Optional

* 100ÂµF Capacitor beetween GND and VCCfootnote:[Electrolytic capcacitors have polarization. Therefore, connect it in the correct way. The ElCo has a "-" or "+" printed on its cover.] - as closefootnote:[This capacitor is buffering out power peaks of the transceiver module during send and receive; and therefore stabilizes the power for the microcontroller.] as possible to the transceiver module.

== Connections

|===
| Signal   | GPIO | Pin footnote:[Pin on NodeMCU DevKit standard module.] | Color ISO (DIN)footnote:[The color of the wires doesn't matter. ;-)]
| CS/CSN   | 15   | D8   | OG (or)
| CE       |  0   | D3   | BN (br)
| IRQ      |  2   | D4   | BU (bl)
| MISO     | 12   | D6   | GN (gr)
| MOSI     | 13   | D7   | VT (vi)
| SCK/SCLK | 14   | D5   | YE (ge)
| GND      | -    | GND  | BK (sw)
| VCC      | -    | 3.3V | RD (rt)
|===

The pins for CS, CE and IRQ can be specified via the WebGUI.
The pins for MISO, MOSI and SCLK are specified in the https://github.com/lumapu/ahoy/blob/main/src/config/config.h[config.h] (currently starting at line 145).

== Software

To install AhoyDTU on ESP8266:

* download the newest binaries from https://github.com/lumapu/ahoy/releases,
* unzip it,
* upload the binary with `esptool`footnote:[On debian just do an `apt install esptool`.] to you ESP.

Example for upload:

	`esptool write_flash 0x0 ahoy_v0.8.36/ESP8266/231230_ahoy_0.8.36_6fb0535_esp8266.bin`


If you like to watch serial output, you may use screen for that:

	`screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200`
